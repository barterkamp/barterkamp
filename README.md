## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In march of 2001 I published my first table based HTML website. And then I just stopped because of other priorities. But here I am again! Hoping to become a frontend developer.

### Learning :mortar_board: 

I started my journey in November of 2021. 

Some of the tutorials I use to help me understand:

+ [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)
+ [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/)
+ [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

### Building :wrench:

I signed up with frontend mentor to escape tutorial hell.

A small selection of projects I've build:

+ [Typemaster Landingpage](https://typemaster-version-2.vercel.app/)
  - Build with HTML and CSS
  
+ [Multi-page minimalist portfolio site](https://minimalist-portfolio-git-master-barterkamp.vercel.app/)
  - Build with HTML, CSS and a touch of Vanilla Javascript

+ [Tip Calculator](https://tip-calculator-barterkamp.vercel.app/)
  - Build with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. 
    * I struggled a lot to get the logic right (and sometimes had to look at someone else's code to get unstuck)
    
+ [Audiophile Webshop](https://barterkamp.github.io/audiophile-webshop/)
  - Build with React, React router, Redux toolkit
    * (This is still a work in progress)

### Solving :crystal_ball:

Besides building projects I also occasionally try to solve a JavaScript coding challenge.
(Tbh, I'm still on easy mode)
